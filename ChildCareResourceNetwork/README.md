Here’s an idea from CCRN to get you started:

The CCRN “Child Care Locator” could be a user-friendly interactive tool that gives parents and guardians 

the ability to search for nearby child care providers. The tool would be accessible as a downloadable mobile 

app, by website, and through SMS/Text queries. The primary goal is to give parents a simple and easy way to 

locate and connect with affordable high quality center or home-based child care providers in close proximity to 

their home, work, or a relative’s home.

To maximize usability for CCRN and those they serve:

● Interactive mapping of child care provider locations represented by a dot or pin that can be clicked on to 

display more information

● Accessible as a downloadable mobile app, the internet and through text messaging

● Multiple Language functionality

● Given the option to view search results in list or map form

● The ability to save providers as favorites for easy viewing later

● CCRN would have the ability to update information, add new sites, delete closed sites, etc.

● Ability to identify and share additional resources

○ Name, Business Name, Contact, Hours of Care, Ages of Children, Transportation, etc.

○ Child Care Checklist, Affordability, Community Resources, Referral Contact
