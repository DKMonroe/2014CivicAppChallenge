Dataset:

600+ Tools in the UHTL Inventory 

(Tool type, description, late fees, replacement cost, etc.)

______________________________________________________________________________________

Here’s an idea from the University Heights Tool Library to get you started:

Although we’ve offered our inventory as the open dataset, what the UHTL is really about is people connecting 

with each other to share resources (but we can’t share our membership dataset). There are two potential areas 

in which a new sharing platform could be developed. First, using a tool like RapidSMS would allow people 

without internet or smartphone access to query our database through a text-based system. Alternatively, 

the development of a mobile-based neighbor-to-neighbor (i.e. peer-to-peer) tool sharing platform could be a 

significant innovation. Our work is limited to the extent our members can travel to get the tools they need from 

our shop, but everyone needs tools (and tool libraries aren’t everywhere - so what do you do?). The UHTL 

envisions the creation of a platform that allows individuals to ‘inventory’ the tools in their basements/garages 

that others can request to borrow. 

To maximize usability for the University Heights Tool Library and those they serve:

● Interactive map with the location of lenders and borrowers in your area

● Differentiation between UHTL tool inventory and neighbor inventories

● Searchable inventory of all tools within a 0.5-, 1-, 2-, 5-, etc mile radius

● Automated email/text reminders for receipts, returns, and overdue tools

● Rating system for lenders and borrowers (similar to hosts and guests in Couchsurfing)

● See RapidSMS: https://www.rapidsms.org/ 

● Language Functionality/integration of Google Translate
