Here’s an idea from the UHC and ReTree the District to get you started:

This dataset was constructed from a set of community mapping exercises that took place throughout 2014. The system 

uses Open Data Kit, Google Fusion Tables, and Enketo webforms to create an integrated, low-cost, and automated 

data collection and mapping system. This setup struggles from a lack of automated geocoding and difficulty in setting 

up the system, particularly for users with no technical background. After developing the system for ReTree the District, 

the project team started to realize that the tool could be used for a variety of other community challenges (e.g. blighted 

properties, graffiti, and other quality-of-life issues). The University Heights Collaborative and ReTree the District envision 

the creation of an intuitive, open, and easy-to-set-up system that allows communities to build their own surveys and track 

community challenges for the purposes of community-level advocacy and action (including, but beyond, trees). 

To maximize usability for the UHC and those they serve:

● Interactive map with the location of chosen issues represented by a dot/pin with the ability to click and see a info 

box or scroll down of information on the site

● Database accessible through a mobile app, the internet, or through texting

● Automated geocoding and user-centric interface for creating and deploying community projects

● Administrative user(s) must have the ability to edit existing information

● Open system that allows user to have relative levels of control over the information they wish to collect

● Language Functionality/integration of Google Translate
