Dataset:

105+ Community Gardens in the City of Buffalo

(Location, lot characteristics, food production, limited user demographics, etc.) 

______________________________________________________________________________________

Here’s an idea from Grassroots Gardens to get you started:

The data collected by Grassroots Gardens of Buffalo is of the 70+ community gardens in the city of Buffalo. 

They represent public spaces of food production and beautification. This information could be used along 

side park information for families to find the nearest outdoor space. It can also be used in conjunction with 

grocery store and farmers market locations so that people can find a nearby space to grow their own food. 

Demographic data has also begun to be collected, and people can find community gardens where participants 

speak common languages, or are from the same birth country.

To maximize usability for Grassroots Gardens and those they serve:

● An interactive map that displays each garden, the languages spoken there, and garden type

● Accessible through a mobile app or the internet

● Language Functionality/integration of Google Translate

● A mile radius buffer around the gardens to gauge proximity to nearest transportation hubs
