Here’s an idea from PPG and United Way to get you started:

The Digital Advocacy Tool could be an interactive tool for citizens, nonprofits, and community organizations to 

quickly and effectively organize calls-to-action around key public policy issues. Perhaps embeddable via HTML 

into a website or mobile app, this tool would allow organizations to draft form letters/emails/phone scripts that 

could be edited by the user. Users could also have greater connectivity with elected officials via social media. 

The primary goal of this tool would be to provide a platform for citizens and the community to engage in public 

policy activities and civic life. Ideally, a person would submit their local address or use GPS to find hyper-local 

issues in their area.

To maximize usability for PPG, United Way, and those they serve:

● Interactive map with details of ongoing uses of the tool

● Accessible through a mobile app and the web

● Ability to add, update, and delete issues

● Ability to type in address and obtain local, county, state, and federal representatives/contact info

● Ability to send emails, integrate with social media, and share updates/official responses

● Language Functionality/integration of Google Translate
