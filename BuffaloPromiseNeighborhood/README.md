(Address, condition, occupancy, comments, etc.)
______________________________________________________________________________________

Here’s an idea from Buffalo Promise Neighborhood to get you started:
In Summer 2014, BPN facilitated a process that resulted in the categorization of over 3700 properties within the BPN Zone as in good condition, fair condition, or blighted and/or vacant.  These data points are viewable in a map that you can find here. Block clubs, residents, neighborhood associations, and other volunteers worked collaboratively to create this comprehensive map and dataset. Each point has a variety of information associated with it, and residents can click on a point to report a blighted property to 311. This dataset can contribute to the creation of a model community-driven blight monitoring and tracking system. Starting in the BPN Zone, with the potential for use across the City of Buffalo, these data can support more effective decision-making regarding resource allocation and policy-making, as well as empowering neighborhoods to drive local change by focusing efforts on holding absentee property owners accountable and working cooperatively with public and private partners to overcome challenges associated with housing vacancy and concentrated poverty.

To maximize usability for Buffalo Promise Neighborhood and those they serve:
Residents should be able to identify and report problematic properties
Communities can gauge which properties are the ‘biggest’ problems by counting the number of times a property is reported to 311
Users should be able to monitor property owner actions
Once reported to the Division of Citizen Services, residents could follow the actions the city is taking to address the problem property 
Residents and other users should be able to track government responsiveness
By integrating already-available county and city property owner and tax payment information, the system could determine if problem properties are vacant or owned/neglected by out-of-state or international owners
