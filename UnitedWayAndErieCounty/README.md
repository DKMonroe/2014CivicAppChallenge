Dataset:

265+ Schools and 25+ Districts

(Location, Contact, Demographic, Socioeconomic, and Performance Data)

______________________________________________________________________________________

Here’s an idea from United Way to get you started:

These datasets have been taken from the NYS Education Department’s online data system. We typically use 

the data to compare schools and identify where there are challenges. A School Selection and Comparison 

tool would help United Way in its ongoing analyses, while assisting current and prospective Erie County 

residents in the search for knowledge about the schools their children attend or will attend. With an influx 

of new companies and emerging entrepreneurial activities, the ability for parents to navigate and compare 

school districts in Erie County will become increasingly important. An ideal system would incorporate additional 

information including on-site extracurricular activities, behavioral supports, academic supports, and greater 

ability for parents to connect with their students’ teachers. 

To maximize usability for United Way and those they serve:

● Interactive map with details of each school

● Accessible through a mobile app, the web, and or SMS-based queries

● Ability to add, update, and delete schools

● Ability to rate and review schools

● Ability to send emails and integrate with social media

● Language Functionality/integration of Google Translate
