Parent Network of WNY is here to help our community support families of children with learning challenges, 

disabilities and special needs. We provide education, information and support. The community can call with a 

question, come to a workshop or conference and enjoy our online learning opportunities. Our website is full of 

information about learning disabilities, education and strategies for success.

Here’s an idea from the Parent Network of WNY to get you started:

Like everyone else, families with children with disabilities, often find there is just not enough time in the day 

or energy to keep up with the demands of life. It is often difficult to find opportunities to participate in social 

activities, make friends or connect with other parents and family members. The parent who only has a couple 

of minutes here and there may not choose to spend that time contacting us for information, attending a 

workshop or searching our website. They may be too tired by the time they get home to even turn on their 

computer. We need an innovative way - with bells and whistles - to reach these families. An interactive app 

would allow the community to access the information on their phone or tablets while talking with another parent 

in the grocery line, waiting in doctor’s offices and everywhere else we all use apps. Parent Network envisions 

that tools developed from these datasets could be a resource for families and professionals searching for 

information needed to increase the involvement of individuals with disabilities within our community.

To maximize usability for the Parent Network of WNY and those they serve:

● User friendly - easy to search and navigate

● We envision the app could:

○ Accessible for individuals with disabilities, easy-to-update, administrator editing capacities

○ Link to location/map, distinct yet interconnected, administrator ability to add narrative sections to 

listings

○ Allow users rate and comment on different services – similar to yelp

○ Allow users to add sites, with administrative restrictions on publication

○ Be easily duplicated for similar future datasets
